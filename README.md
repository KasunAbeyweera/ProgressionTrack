# Progression Outcome Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple Python program that allows users to predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic year based on the provided University regulations.

The program includes features for validation, multiple outcomes prediction, and the generation of a progression histogram.

## Features

- Predict progression outcomes for individual students.
- Validate user input for credits.
- Handle multiple outcomes predictions for different students.
- Display a histogram representing the distribution of progression outcomes.
- Store and display progression data using lists.
- Save progression data to a text file.

## Requirements
